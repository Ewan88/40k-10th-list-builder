CHAOS KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES
Where Chaos Knights tread, the skies grow
unnaturally dark and the dread of the warp permeates
the battlefield. None are immune to its shadowy
touch, for those it does not paralyse with fear
and despair are wracked with hallucinations and
driven mad.
HARBINGERS OF DREAD
If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, each model
from your army with this ability gains a bonus
depending on which Dread abilities are active for
your army (see below). Once a Dread ability is active
for your army, that ability applies until the end of
the battle.
BATTLE ROUND 1 ONWARDS
From the first battle round onwards, the Despair
ability is active for your army:
DESPAIR (AURA)
While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model,
each time that enemy unit takes a Battle-shock or
Leadership test, subtract 1 from that test.
BATTLE ROUND 3 ONWARDS
From the third battle round onwards, the Doom and
Darkness ability is active for your army:
DOOM AND DARKNESS
■ Each time this model makes an attack, if the target
is Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Wound roll.
■ Each time an attack targets this model, if the
attacking model’s unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1
from the Hit roll.
SUPER-HEAVY WALKER
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal,
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there.
DREADBLADES
Dreadblades often wander the galaxy, carving
a path of destruction and slaughtering foes
alongside other forces of Chaos as and when
they will.
If every model in your army has the Chaos
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic
Chaos Knights model or up to 3 War Dog
models in your army, even if they do not have
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select
Army Faction step. None of these models
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be
given Enhancements.
CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, you can use
this Traitoris Lance Detachment rule.
FORGED IN TERROR (AURA)
Chaos Knights are servants of shadow and terror;
wherever they stride, fear and madness spread.
In the Battle-shock step of your opponent’s Command
phase, if an enemy unit that is below its Starting
Strength is within 12" of a Chaos Knights model
from your army, that enemy unit must take a Battleshock test. For the purposes of this ability, if a unit
has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to be
below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or
more wounds.
Designer’s Note: This means that all enemy units
within range of this Aura ability that have lost one or
more models must take a Battle-shock test in your
opponent’s Command phase, not just those that are
Below Half-strength.
If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Enhancements.
LORD OF DREAD
This tyrannical Knight is the epitome of dread power,
instilling as much fear in their minions as they do over
the enemy, ensuring unwavering obedience.
Chaos Knights model only. At the start of the
Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within
Engagement Range of the bearer; that enemy unit
must take a Battle-shock test.
AURA OF TERROR
This towering Knight is wreathed in tendrils of warp
energy that caress the minds of any enemy who
draws near, driving those touched into a state of
abject fear. Wherever this Knight treads, this aura of
terror permeates and corrupts the land until it can
be cleansed.
Chaos Knights model only. If you control an
objective marker at the end of your Command phase,
and the bearer is within range of that objective
marker, that objective marker is said to be Tainted
and remains under your control even if you have no
models within range of it, until your opponent controls
it at the start or end of any turn. In addition, while an
objective marker is Tainted and under your control
and the Despair Dread ability is active for your army,
that objective marker has the Despair Dread ability as
if it was a Chaos Knights model from your army (so
subtract 1 from Battle-shock and Leadership tests
taken for enemy units within 12" of it).
THE TRAITOR’S MARK
The dark deeds and bloodstained heraldry of this
Chaos Knight are whispered far and wide. Rumours
spread that to confront it is to face a painful death.
Each blazon borne upon its hull proclaims the unholy
atrocities committed by the bearer, and even to look
upon these loathsome sigils is to be gripped by
unnatural terror and beset by swarming nightmares.
Chaos Knights model only. The Doom and Darkness
ability is active for the bearer from the first battle
round onwards, instead of from the third.
PANOPLY OF THE CURSED KNIGHTS
Borne within an unmarked casket by an order of
silent Idolators, this collection of tattered pennants,
chain-strung charms and armour scraps represent
the last remains of the Knight Carnivus Grymm. It
is said that festooning one’s Knight suit with these
charms instils the legendary fortitude of that doomed
war engine. Yet it is whispered that doing so also
invites the attentions of the same dread curse that
eventually led to Carnivus Grymm’s ghastly end.
Chaos Knights model only. Each time an attack is
made against the bearer, subtract 1 from the Armour
Penetration characteristic of that attack.

CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Stratagems.
DREAD HOUNDS
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
War Dog pilots encircle their terrified
victims then attack in a ferocious mass.
WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more War Dog units from
your army and one enemy unit that is an
eligible target for each of those selected
War Dog units.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
the selected War Dog units can only
target that enemy unit, but all weapons
equipped by those War Dog models gain
the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. In addition,
if that enemy unit is Battle-shocked, until
the end of the phase, each time a selected
War Dog model makes an attack against
that enemy unit, an unmodified Hit roll of
5+ scores a Critical Hit.
DISDAIN FOR THE WEAK
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Chaos Knight pilots refuse to yield while
foes remain to be slain, disdainfully
ignoring those who succumb to fear.
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from
your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your
model has the Feel No Pain 6+ ability, and
the Feel No Pain 5+ ability against attacks
made by Battle-shocked models.
PTERRORSHADES
TRAITORIS LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Shrieking with ghoulish hunger, daemonic
entities descend in a tatterwinged
whirlwind to rend apart the souls of those
enemies who show even a moment’s fear.
The soul-raptors tear apart their victims’
animus and, as they feed, this life force
is channelled to regenerate the battle
damage or heal the pilot of the Knight in
which these creatures roost.
WHEN: Any phase, just after an enemy
unit fails a Battle-shock test.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from
your army that is within 12" of that
enemy unit.
EFFECT: Roll six D6. For each 4+, that
enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound and
this model regains up to 1 lost wound.

A LONG LEASH
TRAITORIS LANCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
The War Dogs of the Chaos Knights are
more terrified of their lords than they
are the enemy, and they heed their
masters well, for they know the price of
disobedience or disloyalty.
WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Abhorrent model from your
army and up to three War Dog models
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next
Command phase, those War Dog models
count as being within range of any Aura
abilities that Abhorrent model has.
KNIGHTS OF SHADE
TRAITORIS LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Like dark phantoms, some Chaos
Knights can move through solid walls
without hindrance.
WHEN: Your Movement phase or your
Charge phase.
TARGET: Up to two War Dog models from
your army or one Titanic Chaos Knights
model from your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, the
selected models can move horizontally
through models and terrain features as if
they were not there.
DIABOLIC BULWARK
TRAITORIS LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Ectoplasmic blood surges hot through
glowing conduits as the Chaos Knight
feeds power to its shield emitters.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,
just after an enemy unit has selected
its targets.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from
your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
that Chaos Knights model has a 4+
invulnerable save against ranged attacks.

WAR DOG STALKER
Only the most strong-willed of minor nobility have the mental fortitude
to pilot a Stalker. Like pack alphas, they often lead other War Dogs
in carefully planned attacks, harrying the foe’s flanks, butchering
reinforcements and hunting down lone threats. They unleash salvoes
of fire at range or in the heart of combat with deadly claw strikes.

WAR DOG KARNIVORE
Aggressive and bloodthirsty, Karnivores eschew the more potent
ranged weapons of the War Dog chassis. They revel in causing
bloody confusion and despair, seeking the visceral thrill that only
close-quarters slaughter provides. As a result, many of their pilots fall
to the open worship of one of the Chaos Gods.

KNIGHT TYRANT
So massive that they loom over other Chaos Knights, Knights Tyrant
are walking bastions of corruption. They carry some of the heaviest
armaments available to the Fallen houses. Their pilots delight in
unleashing the deadly potential of these weapons, shrugging off the
enemy’s attacks with contemptuous ease.
