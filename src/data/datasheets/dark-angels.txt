DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE
No matter the foe or the odds, the proud warriors of
the Dark Angels stubbornly refuse to accept defeat.
None fight with more grim determination than
the battle-brothers of the Dark Angels, and their
renowned specialised companies – the Deathwing
and Ravenwing – are held in awe by their allies and
enemies alike.
If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can
use this Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule.
RESTRICTIONS
■ Your army can include Dark Angels units, but it
cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn
from any other Chapter.
GRIM RESOLVE
The Dark Angels are renowned for their unshakeable
resolve, enduring tenacity and strict discipline in
battle. They are tactically astute, able to prosecute
their wars on any front. On the offence, they strike
with all the martial pride of the Lion, while in defence
they are stalwart, determined to accomplish their
mission no matter the cost.
While an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army
is Battle-shocked, change the Objective Control
characteristic of models in that unit to 1, instead of 0.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task
Force Stratagems.
UNFORGIVEN FURY
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE
TACTIC STRATAGEM
With focused aggression, the Dark Angels
relentlessly punish the foe.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army that has not been selected to
shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
weapons equipped by models in your
unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability. In
addition, if one or more Adeptus Astartes
units from your army are currently
Battle-shocked, until the end of the phase,
each time a model in your unit makes an
attack, a successful unmodified Hit roll of
5+ scores a Critical Hit.
INTRACTABLE
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC
PLOY STRATAGEM
Although stubborn warriors, even the
resolute Dark Angels know that a fighting
retreat can be the wisest course of action.
WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, that unit
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge,
even though it Fell Back this phase.
ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE
TACTIC STRATAGEM
The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes
combined with their transhuman
physiology makes them unyielding foes
to face.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets your unit, worsen
the Armour Penetration characteristic of
that attack by 1.
FIRE DISCIPLINE
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC
STRATAGEM
There is no escaping the Unforgiven’s
wrath when they bring their disciplined
firepower to bear.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army that has not been selected to
shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged
weapons equipped by models in that
unit have the [ASSAULT], [HEAVY] and
[IGNORES COVER] abilities.

STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task
Force Stratagems.
GRIM RETRIBUTION
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC
PLOY STRATAGEM
The Dark Angels are renowned for yielding
nothing to the enemy, and fighting back
with unanswerable fury in the face of
odds that would force even other Adeptus
Astartes to reconsider their position.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,
just after an enemy unit has shot.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army that had one or more models
destroyed as a result of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were
your Shooting phase, but it must target
the enemy unit that just attacked it, and
can only do so if that enemy unit is an
eligible target.
UNBREAKABLE LINES
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC
STRATAGEM
Countless assaults have faltered against
the unbreakable ceramite wall that is the
Unforgiven standing their ground.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just
after an enemy unit ends a Charge move.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army within Engagement Range of
that enemy unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, each
time an attack is allocated to a model in
your unit, subtract 1 from the Damage
characteristic of that attack.
1CP 1CP
If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task
Force Enhancements.
SHROUD OF HEROES
When one of the Dark Angels’ mightiest warriors is
slain in battle, his recovered remains are wrapped
in a death shroud until he can be interred within the
crypts of the Lion’s Sanctum. Pieces of this fabric are
then stitched into a single set of robes known as the
Shroud of Heroes, and those who wear it claim they
can feel the powers of their predecessors refusing to
let them yield while their duty remains unfulfilled.
Adeptus Astartes model only. The first time the
bearer is destroyed, roll one D6 at the end of the
phase. On a 2+, set the bearer back up on the
battlefield as close as possible to where it was
destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any
enemy units, with 3 wounds remaining (if the bearer
was Battle-shocked when it was destroyed, it is
instead returned with its full wounds remaining).
STUBBORN TENACITY
Even for a Chapter as famously stubborn as the Dark
Angels, this warrior is known for his intractable nature.
Such tenacity and dedication to duty is an inspiration
to the warriors who follow him – so fortified, enemy
attempts to break them only strengthen their resolve.
Adeptus Astartes model only. While the bearer is
leading a unit, each time a model in that unit makes
an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll if the bearer’s unit is
below its Starting Strength, and add 1 to the Wound
roll as well if the bearer’s unit is Battle-shocked.
HEAVENFALL BLADE
This weapon was bestowed upon the most
honourable Knight of the Order before a long quest
into the wilds of Caliban. Its blade is empowered
by a force generator of magnificent strength. It is a
weighty responsibility to bear such an heirloom into
battle, and a Dark Angel bestowed such an honour
would rather die than bring shame to his Chapter.
Adeptus Astartes model only. Add 1 to the
Attacks, Strength and Damage characteristics of
the bearer’s melee weapons. While the bearer is
Battle-shocked, add 2 to the Attacks, Strength
and Damage characteristics of the bearer’s melee
weapons instead.
PENNANT OF REMEMBRANCE
This hallowed banner records the names and deeds
of the legendary members of the Deathwing that the
company’s bone-coloured armour commemorates.
The legacy of those mighty warriors is one of bravery
and defiance in the face of overwhelming odds.
Under the shadow of their example, every member
of the Chapter fights on through grievous injury
to prove themselves worthy successors of such
martial paragons.
Bladeguard Ancient, Primaris Ancient or
Terminator Ancient model only. While the
bearer is leading a unit, models in that unit
have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. While that unit
is Battle-shocked, models in that unit have the
Feel No Pain 4+ ability instead.
