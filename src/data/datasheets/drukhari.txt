DRUKHARI
ARMY RULE
The Drukhari are experts in precise torture, sharp blades, cruel poisons and eldritch abominations. Using the
labyrinthine network of webway spars, they strike almost anywhere. Realspace raiding parties prey upon worlds
across the galaxy, surging from hidden portals unknown to those they see merely as cattle or playthings. As the
Drukhari feed on the souls of the slain, they become imbued with supernatural might, eventually turning into
killing machines.
POWER FROM PAIN
If your Army Faction is Drukhari, units from your army with this ability can become Empowered Through Pain.
This is done using Pain tokens.
GAINING PAIN TOKENS
If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you gain Pain
tokens as follows:
■ At the start of the battle, depending on the
battle size:
COMBAT PATROL 1 PAIN TOKEN
INCURSION 2 PAIN TOKENS
STRIKE FORCE 3 PAIN TOKENS
ONSLAUGHT 4 PAIN TOKENS
■ Each time an enemy unit is destroyed, you gain 1
Pain token.
■ Each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test,
you gain 1 Pain token.
Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side –
this is your Pain token pool.
EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN
At the start of any phase, you can expend one or more
Pain tokens from your Pain token pool. Each time you
do, select one unit from your army with the Power
from Pain ability. Until the end of the phase, that unit
is Empowered, and gains the abilities listed below,
depending on the phase.
 OR
■ Empowered in the Movement or Charge phase:
◦ You can re-roll Advance or Charge rolls made for
that unit.
 OR
■ Empowered in the Shooting or Fight phase:
◦ Each time a model in that unit makes an attack,
you can re-roll the Hit roll.
DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can use this
Realspace Raiders Detachment rule.
REALSPACE RAIDERS
The three factions of the Drukhari are constantly
vying for supremacy, each convinced beyond
doubt of their own innate superiority. This struggle
manifests during their realspace raids as a frenzy of
murderously sadistic competition.
At the start of the battle, you gain an additional 1 Pain
token for each of the following your army contains:
■ One or more Archon models
■ One or more Succubus models
■ One or more Haemonculus models
Designer’s Note: These are all cumulative, so if
your army contains at least one Archon, at least
one Succubus and at least one Haemonculus,
you would start the battle with an additional 3
Pain tokens.
DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Stratagems.
PREY ON THE WEAK
 REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The scent of a foe in pain draws Drukhari
to it like hungry predators to an injured
beast, their senses sharpening at its tang.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Kabal unit from your
army and one enemy unit that is
Below Half-strength.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes an attack
that targets that enemy unit, you can
re-roll the Wound roll.
STRIKE AND FADE
REALSPACE RAIDERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
The Drukhari are masters at using
hit-and-run tactics, engaging a target
with a flurry of shots before quickly
manoeuvring into cover or out of sight.
WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your
army (excluding Aircraft).
EFFECT: Your unit can immediately make a
Normal move.
RESTRICTIONS: Until the end of the turn,
your unit is not eligible to declare a charge
and that unit cannot embark within a
Transport at the end of this move.
ACROBATIC DISPLAY
REALSPACE RAIDERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Many Wych Cults favour spectacular
gymnastic displays. Their fighters are
never still, springing from one foot to the
other at blinding speed.
WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Wych Cult unit from
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your
unit is eligible to declare a charge even if it
Fell Back or Advanced this turn.

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Stratagems.
ALLIANCE OF AGONY
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Even the most bloodthirsty Drukhari
will veil their enmity to work together
against a shared enemy for the same
gruesome purpose.
WHEN: Start of any phase.
TARGET: One Archon, one Succubus and
one Haemonculus from your army.
EFFECT: Discard one Pain token from
your Pain token pool. Until the end of the
phase, all three of those models’ units
are Empowered.
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this
Stratagem if you are able to select all
three of the target models stated above.
QUICKSILVER REACTIONS
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The hyper-fast reflexes of the Drukhari
allow them to duck and weave to avoid all
but the swiftest enemy strikes.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your
army that was selected as the target of
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack that targets your unit,
subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target a
Haemonculus Covens unit from your
army for this Stratagem.
INSENSIBLE TO PAIN
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The twisted creations of the Haemonculus
Covens are insensible to all but the most
mortal injuries.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Haemonculus Covens unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets your unit, subtract
1 from the Wound roll.
1CP

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Enhancements.
CRUCIBLE OF MALEDICTION
When opened, the souls of tortured psykers spew
outward, driving any nearby warp-wielders insane.
Haemonculus model only. Once per battle, at the
start of any Shooting phase, the bearer can use this
Enhancement. When it does, every enemy unit within
12" must take a Battle-shock test, subtracting 1 from
that test if the bearer’s unit is currently Empowered.
Each time a Psyker unit fails this test, it suffers D3
mortal wounds.
LABYRINTHINE CUNNING
This Archon has a mind like steel traps, assimilating
every detail of a situation.
Archon model only. Each time you select the bearer’s
unit as the target of a Stratagem, roll one D6, adding 3
to the result if the Stratagem being used is Alliance of
Agony: on a 4+, you gain 1CP.
BLOOD DANCER
This Succubus is renowned for their expertise
at close-quarters combat within the arenas of
Commorragh. The skills they display before the
baying crowds on the blood-soaked sands are
equally deadly on the battlefield.
Succubus model only. Improve the Attacks and
Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s
melee weapons by 1. While the bearer is Empowered,
Improve the Attacks and Armour Penetration
characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by
2 instead.
THE ART OF PAIN
Some Drukhari elevate their battle plans to another
level by creating a spectacle of torment that maims
and cripples every foe in order to draw out the
moment of the kill, heightening the pleasure they
derive before the fatal blow falls.
Drukhari model only. In your Command phase, if the
bearer is on the battlefield, you gain 1 Pain token.
