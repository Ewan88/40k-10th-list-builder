AGENTS OF THE IMPERIUM
ARMY RULE
Throughout the Imperium there exist numerous martial
organisations and shadowy institutions. Bodies of armed
warriors or solitary agents from these groups possess
specialist skills, unusual equipment and vested interests
that lead them to be attached to larger Imperial armies.
Some are requisitioned by the army’s commander for their
particular abilities, others are assigned by their hidden
masters to achieve singular agendas. The most powerful
have the authority and reputation to enforce their presence
on the field of battle.
ASSIGNED AGENTS
If every model in your army has the Imperium keyword,
you can include Agents of the Imperium units in your
army even if they do not have the Faction keyword you
selected in the Select Army Faction step. The maximum
number of Agents of the Imperium units you can include
in your army depends on the battle size, as shown below.

INQUISITOR GREYFAX
Inquisitor Greyfax is feared even by many in her own order, the Ordo
Hereticus. Devoid of mercy or remorse, she is an iron-willed warrior.

radical for this, but her commitment to the Imperium is undeniable.
