NECRONS
ARMY RULE
The scattered dynasties of the Necrons pursue many
different paths to dominance, embracing their own
traditions and martial doctrines. All dynasties also benefit
from the nigh-supernatural technologies that once saw
them dominate the galaxy, perhaps the most unsettling
of which are their reanimation protocols. Should a Necron
be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow.
Crawling limbs reattach, sundered torsos and smashed
skulls reform and the Necron rises again, shambling back
into battle.
REANIMATION PROTOCOLS
If your Army Faction is Necrons, at the end of your
Command phase, each unit from your army with this
ability activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates
D3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:
■ If that unit contains one or more models with fewer
than their starting number of wounds remaining,
select one of those models; that model regains one
lost wound.
■ If all models in that unit have their starting number of
wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength,
one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one
wound remaining.
Once such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its
models have their starting number of wounds, nothing
further happens.
Example: A unit of Lokhust Destroyers (which have a
Wounds characteristic of 3) activates its Reanimation
Protocols. The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but
currently contains 2 models, and one of those models
has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many
wounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated
wounds restores the wounded Lokhust Destroyer
back to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated
wounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the
battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these
reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost
wounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just
returned. The unit now contains 3 models, two
of which have 3 wounds remaining and one of
which has 2 wounds remaining.
NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Necrons, you can use this
Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule.
COMMAND PROTOCOLS
The Necron nobility make war in a codified and relentless
fashion. Their command protocols crackle out across
multi-dimensional spectra from carrier-wave projectors,
compelling their semi-sentient soldiery into battle one
overriding directive at a time.
While a Necrons Character model is leading this unit,
each time a model in this unit makes an attack, add 1 to
the Hit roll.
NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule, you can use these Awakened
Dynasty Stratagems.
PROTOCOL OF THE ETERNAL GUARDIAN
AWAKENED DYNASTY – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Necron rulers possess sophisticated
self-repair systems that can reknit their
corporeal forms so they can once more
command their legions.
WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Necrons Infantry
Character model from your army that
was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Set your model back up on the
battlefield as close as possible to where
it was destroyed and more than 1" away
from all enemy models, with half of its
starting number of wounds remaining.
RESTRICTIONS: Each model can only
be targeted with this Stratagem once
per battle.
PROTOCOL OF THE HUNGRY VOID
AWAKENED DYNASTY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The Necrons strike with data-augmented
accuracy, their murderous attacks as
inescapable as the killing cold of space.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your
army that has not been selected to fight
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, add
1 to the Strength characteristic of melee
weapons equipped by models in your
unit. In addition, If a Necrons Character
is leading your unit, until the end of the
phase, improve the Armour Penetration
characteristic of melee weapons
equipped by models in your unit by 1.
PROTOCOL OF THE CONQUERING TYRANT
AWAKENED DYNASTY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The legions employ the strategies of their
masters in perfect synchronicity, laying
down hails of mechanically coordinated fire.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your
army that has not been selected to shoot
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes an attack
that targets a unit within half of the firing
weapon’s range, you can re-roll the Wound
roll. If a Necrons Character is leading
your unit, until the end of the phase, this
effect applies at the firing weapon’s full
range instead.

NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule, you can use these Awakened
Dynasty Stratagems.
PROTOCOL OF THE UNDYING LEGIONS
AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
At a hissing static signal, nanoscarabs
are released in boiling black clouds
that whirl about the legions and effect
constant repairs.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your
army that had one or more of its models
destroyed as a result of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit activates its
Reanimation Protocols and reanimates
D3 wounds. When doing so, if a Necrons
Character is leading your unit, your unit
reanimates D3+1 wounds instead.
PROTOCOL OF THE SUDDEN STORM
AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Arcing energies leap from one Necron unit
to the next, lending speed to their limbs
and causing their eye lenses to blaze.
WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, ranged
weapons equipped by models in your unit
have the [ASSAULT] ability. In addition, if a
Necrons Character is leading your unit,
until the end of the phase, you can re-roll
Advance rolls made for your unit.
PROTOCOL OF THE VENGEFUL STARS
AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
In response to enemy attack, criss-cross
fire leaps from the Necron ranks, forming
a blazing corona of deadly energy from
which there can be no escape.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,
just after an enemy unit has resolved
its attacks.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your
army that had one or more of its models
destroyed as a result of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were
your Shooting phase, but it must target
the enemy unit that just attacked it, and
can only do so if that enemy unit is an
eligible target. In addition, if a Necrons
Character is leading your unit, until
the end of the phase, ranged weapons
equipped by models in your unit have the
[IGNORES COVER] ability.

If you are using the Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule, you can use these Awakened Dynasty Enhancements.
VEIL OF DARKNESS
This device was fashioned from transpositanium,
a substance so rare that it can only be found in a
handful of places in the galaxy. It is highly sought
after by the Necrons, and wars have been waged to
secure it. Activated with a thought, the Veil causes
space and time to warp around its user and those
near them, enfolding them in a swirling darkness.
As the darkness fades, the user and their comrades
appear elsewhere on the battlefield, transported
through a miracle of arcane science.
Necrons model only. Once per battle, at the end of
your opponent’s turn, if the bearer’s unit is not within
Engagement Range of any enemy units, the bearer
can use this Enhancement. If it does, remove that
unit from the battlefield. Then, in the Reinforcements
step of your next Movement phase, set up that unit
anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9"
horizontally away from all enemy models.
HYPERMATERIAL ABLATOR
By simply pointing and activating this slender
quasinium rod, the bearer shrouds their allies in a
whirling field of accumulated hypermatter.
Necrons model only. While the bearer is leading
a unit, models in that unit have the Stealth ability.
In addition, each time a ranged attack targets the
bearer’s unit, if the attacker is not within 12", models
in that unit have the Benefit of Cover.
THE SOVEREIGN CORONAL (AURA)
A band of living quicksilver, this strange artefact is
shot through with artificial networks of commandwave nano-circuitry. This strange pseudo-animate
crown is gifted to especially prominent nobles.
As it is donned it sinks through the metallic
skin of its wearer’s brow and meshes with their
synthetic cortex, enhancing and projecting their
dominating will through multiple spectra across a
substantial distance.
Necrons model only. While a friendly Necrons unit
is within 6" of the bearer, that unit counts as being led
by a Necrons Character model.
Designer’s Note: This means that units within range
of this Aura ability will benefit from the Command
Protocols ability and will count as containing a
Character for the purposes of any Awakened
Dynasty Stratagems.
SEMPITERNAL WEAVE
Only the finest Cryptek artificers know the secret of
crafting a Sempiternal Weave. These gossamer-thin
plates are formed from phase-hardened amarathine
and threads of adamantine. They are then layered
over the bearer’s carapace of living metal, stiffening
and contracting when struck to turn aside energy
blades, bolt shells and even the searing heat of a
plasma burst.
Necrons model only. The bearer has the
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

DEPLOYMENT
When this unit is first set up on the battlefield, its models do
not have to be set up in Unit Coherency. Instead, each model
must be set up wholly within 12" of one other model from its
unit. From that point on, each model in this unit is treated as
a separate unit.
CONVERGENCE OF DOMINION
Starsteles were placed upon worlds as territorial markers and
silent guardians by jealous Necron nobles. Over the millennia they
have become forgotten archaeological curios, or feared sources of
superstitious rumour about vanishments and strange lights. Now they
awaken again as their masters do.
