BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
DETACHMENT RULE
Gene-sons of the angel-winged Primarch Sanguinius, the Blood Angels descend into battle on flaming wings to
stand between the Emperor’s servants and the heretical and alien hordes that seek to destroy them. Masters
of the rapid assault, the mechanised offensive and the swift airborne strike, they have carved out a legacy of
victories that stretches across the ages.
If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can
use this Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule.
RESTRICTIONS
■ Your army can include Blood Angels units, but it
cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn
from any other Chapter.
THE RED THIRST
Though they strive to restrain it, the murderous
ferocity of the Blood Angels simmers beneath the
surface of their thoughts. In battle, this rage drives
them towards the foe and lends great strength to
their blows.
Each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your
army is selected to fight, if that unit made a Charge
move this turn, until the end of the phase, add 1 to
the Strength and Attacks characteristics of melee
weapons equipped by models in that unit.

BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of
Sanguinius Stratagems.
ANGEL’S SACRIFICE
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
The Blood Angels would gladly put
themselves in harm’s way to protect
others, exemplifying the sacrifice
of Sanguinius.
WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes
Character unit from your army that
was just destroyed. You can use this
Stratagem on that unit even though it was
just destroyed.
EFFECT: Until the end of the battle, each
time a friendly Adeptus Astartes unit
makes an attack that targets the enemy
unit that just destroyed your Character
unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll.
ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes
combined with their transhuman
physiology makes them unyielding foes
to face.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets your unit, worsen
the Armour Penetration characteristic of
that attack by 1.
AGGRESSIVE ONSLAUGHT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The Sons of Sanguinius constantly
push towards new foes, the bloodlust
singing in their veins unleashed in a
controlled dynamism.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes
unit from your army, just before that
unit Consolidates.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
each time a model in your unit makes a
Consolidation move, it can move up to
6" instead of up to 3", provided your unit
ends that Consolidation move in Unit
Coherency and within Engagement Range
of one or more enemy units.
RED RAMPAGE
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
In times of great desperation, fury and
ferocity can be a warrior’s strongest allies.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army that has not been selected to
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
melee weapons equipped by models
in your unit have the [LANCE] and
[LETHAL HITS] abilities.

Sanguinius Stratagems.
ONLY IN DEATH DOES DUTY END
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Imminent death does not prevent a Space
Marine from enacting his final justice
upon the enemies of the Imperium.
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if
that model has not fought this phase, do
not remove it from play. The destroyed
model can fight after the attacking
model’s unit has finished making its
attacks, and is then removed from play.
RELENTLESS ASSAULT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
The Blood Angels are loathe to resort to
the defensive strategies favoured by
other Chapters, and a tactical withdrawal
is but a prelude to re-entering the fray.
WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit
is eligible to declare a charge even though
it Fell Back this phase.
2CP 1CP
If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of Sanguinius Enhancements.
ARTISAN OF WAR
This warrior is a true artist both on and off the
battlefield. His talents are reflected in the exquisite
workmanship of his wargear, for he insists upon
personally crafting his weapons of war.
Adeptus Astartes model only. Improve the Armour
Penetration characteristic of the bearer’s weapons by
1, and the bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.
VISAGE OF DEATH
This exquisitely crafted mask is a thing of dark beauty
to the Blood Angels, and a sign of impending doom
to their enemies. The unchanging expression of the
mask inspires fear and uncertainty even in confident
enemies. They see no anger, pain or elation on the
wearer’s face – clues as to the warrior’s state of mind
in a duel.
Adeptus Astartes model only. While an enemy
unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) is within
Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit, halve the
Objective Control characteristic of models in that unit.
ARCHANGEL’S SHARD
When Sanguinius battled Horus, his magnificent
blade was tragically shattered against the
Warmaster’s profane battle plate. The shards
were gathered up and new swords forged to
incorporate them, each one gifted to a different
successor Chapter.
Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s
melee weapons have the [ANTI-CHAOS 5+] and
[LANCE] abilities.
ICON OF THE ANGEL
Entrusted to one whose faith in the primogenitor is
profound, the Icon of the Angel takes the form of a
small shrine upon the bearer’s backpack. Through
displaying it, this warrior reminds his brothers of the
heretics who fled after laying low the Angel, exhorting
them to let no enemy escape their grasp again.
Adeptus Astartes model only. Each time an enemy
unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) within
Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit is selected
to Fall Back, models in that enemy unit must
take Desperate Escape tests as if their unit was
Battle-shocked. When doing so, if that enemy unit is
also Battle-shocked by other means, subtract 1 from
each of those Desperate Escape tests.

earned fame and renown, and there that he suffered the wound that

apart with beams of energy.
