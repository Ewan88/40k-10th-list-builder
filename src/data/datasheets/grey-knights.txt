GREY KNIGHTS
ARMY RULE
The soul of the Grey Knights is sacrosanct, and their purity is incorruptible. The silvered armour of this
Chapter’s warriors is bound with incantations, engraved with sigils of warding. Their blades shine with the inner
light of their sanctity, for each of these Space Marines is a psychic warrior, in empyric communion with his
battle-brothers. Empowered by minds constantly on guard, they can cut steel with bare hands, their eyes blaze
with fire and even the power of their words flays the otherworldly skin of daemons. They are the Imperium’s
foremost sword and shield against the daemonic. Guided by the foresight and prophecies of the Chapter’s
Prognosticars, a Grey Knight can adapt to the most irrational of foes and, in a flare of teleportation energies,
emerge at exactly the right location to unleash their devastating power.
TELEPORT ASSAULT
If your Army Faction is Grey Knights, at the end of
your opponent’s turn, you can select a number of
Grey Knights units from your army with this ability
(excluding units that are within Engagement Range
of one or more enemy units). The maximum number
of units you can select depends on the battle size,
as follows:
COMBAT PATROL UP TO 1 UNIT
INCURSION UP TO 2 UNITS
STRIKE FORCE UP TO 3 UNITS
ONSLAUGHT UP TO 4 UNITS
Once you have made your selections,
remove those units from the battlefield. In
the Reinforcements step of your next
Movement phase, set each of those
units up anywhere on the battlefield
that is more than 9" horizontally
away from all enemy models.
Any units that are not on
the battlefield at the
end of the battle count
as destroyed.
GREY KNIGHTS – TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Grey Knights, you can use
this Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule.
TELEPORT SHUNT
Hardened against the corrupting touch of Chaos,
protected by silver sigils and the warriors’ own purity
of spirit, Grey Knights are capable of enduring rapid
and repeated submersions in the warp. When a
lightning-fast purgation is required, orbiting strike
cruisers maintain a constant spiritual lock on their
battle-brothers, enabling Grey Knights to perform
short-ranged teleportations. Flickering in and out
of reality, this exceptional mobility allows them to
outmanoeuvre the most otherworldly of enemies.
Each time a Grey Knights unit with the Deep Strike
ability Advances, do not make an Advance roll.
Instead, until the end of the phase, add 6" to that
unit’s Move characteristic and that unit can Fly.
GREY KNIGHTS – TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule, you can use these Teleport Strike Force Stratagems.
RADIANT STRIKE
TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Psychic fire rimes the blades of the Grey
Knights as they charge at the foe, fanned
by their battle fury. At the moment of
contact, the empyric charge is unleashed
in a blast of azure light.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Grey Knights Psyker unit
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, melee
weapons equipped by models in your unit
with the [PSYCHIC] ability also have the
[DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.
PROGNISTICATED ARRIVAL
TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Accessing a vision granted by the
Chapter’s Prognosticars, the Grey
Knights perceive the hidden ways of the
battlefield and a sliver of the enemy’s
intentions, granting them a prophetic
situational awareness that aids their
strategic disposition.
WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Grey Knights Psyker unit
from your army that is arriving using the
Deep Strike or Teleport Assault abilities
this phase.
EFFECT: Your unit can be set up anywhere
on the battlefield that is more than 3"
horizontally away from all enemy models.
RESTRICTIONS: A unit targeted by this
Stratagem is not eligible to declare a
charge in the same turn.
DEATH FROM THE WARP
TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Utilising their warp-attuned senses during
the timeless instant of teleportation, Grey
Knights know exactly where the enemy
are before they arrive. They emerge
from the blinding flare of warp energies
already firing.
WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Grey Knights Psyker unit
from your army that either Advanced this
turn or arrived using the Deep Strike or
Teleport Assault abilities this turn.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged
weapons equipped by models in your unit
have the [ASSAULT] ability and each time
a model in your unit makes an attack, add
1 to the Hit roll.
HALOED IN SOULFIRE
TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The blazing glare of ancient technology
and the shrouding coils of the
immaterium often linger, obscuring the
Grey Knights’ presence.
WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Grey Knights Psyker unit
from your army that is arriving using the
Deep Strike or Teleport Assault abilities
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next
Movement phase, your unit cannot be
targeted by ranged attacks unless the
attacking model is within 12".

MISTS OF DEIMOS
TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
When the enemy closes in, the Grey
Knights wreathe themselves in psychic
mists to confound the foe while they
reposition until the time is ready to launch
a counter-blow.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase,
just after an enemy unit ends a Normal,
Advance or Fall Back move.
TARGET: One Grey Knights Psyker unit
from your army that is within 9" of that
enemy unit.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal
move of up to 6" as if it were your
Movement phase or, if it has the Deep
Strike ability, it can be placed into
Strategic Reserves.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select a unit
that is within Engagement Range of one or
more enemy units.
TRUESILVER ARMOUR
TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Grey Knights battle plate incorporates
litanies of purity, strands of sanctified
silver and other sacred wards, whose
defences can be further empowered by
ritual mantras.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Grey Knights unit from your
army that was selected as the target of
one or more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets your unit, worsen
the Armour Penetration characteristic of
that attack by 1.

If you are using the Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule, you can use these Teleport Strike
Force Enhancements.
FIRST TO THE FRAY
Whether braving premature teleportation assaults
or leaping from the hatch of a transport still aglow
from atmospheric entry, this sanctified commander
frequently makes the first strike in battle, and ever
from an unexpected quarter. Inspired by such zealous
bravery, his battle-brothers are never far behind.
Grey Knights model with the Deep Strike ability only.
The bearer’s unit must start the battle in Reserves, but
neither it, nor any Transport it is embarked within,
is counted towards any limits the mission places on
the number of Strategic Reserves units you can have.
That unit can be set up using its Deep Strike ability in
the Reinforcements step of your first, second or third
Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules.
DOMINA LIBER DAEMONICA
This tome is said to be a relic of Supreme Grand
Master Janus, he who mastered all six hundred
and sixty-six words of banishment, each one
painstakingly recorded on its pages. In times of need
a hero of the Chapter will carry this book into battle,
its bindings crackling with arcane energy as the
words repel warp entities and send daemons howling
back into the warp.
Grey Knights model only. Each time the bearer
makes a melee attack add 1 to the Wound roll and,
if that attack targets a Daemon unit, add 1 to the
Damage characteristic of that attack as well.
SIGIL OF EXIGENCE
Forged by the Techmarine Dorvel urThann, this
small chor-bronze icon contains a powerful teleport
matrix and a trio of vigilant machine spirits. Their
pre-cogitative psyroutines guard against attacks
from afar, spiriting their host and his allies away from
danger in a blaze of light.
Grey Knights model only. Once per battle, in your
opponent’s Shooting phase, when the bearer’s unit
is selected as the target of a ranged attack, you can
remove the bearer’s unit from the battlefield and then
set it back up again anywhere on the battlefield that
is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy
models. If the bearer is no longer an eligible target,
your opponent can then select new targets for any
attacks that had targeted the bearer’s unit.
INESCAPABLE WRATH
When this warrior leads his battle-brothers into
the foe, they strike like silver lances of lightning.
By focusing his powers upon a pivotal moment, he
connects himself via a tether of inevitability to his
enemies. Drawn by the tether, he bears down upon
them with incredible speed, ensuring none escape his
and his warriors’ wrath.
Grey Knights model only. Add 1 to Charge rolls made
for the bearer’s unit.

with servo-arms or heavy weapons, employed to defend or aid their
Techmarine masters during repairs. The brutal mind-wiping process
ensures none ever reveal what they have witnessed.

GREY KNIGHTS STORMHAWK INTERCEPTOR
Squadrons of Stormhawk Interceptors – such as the Andaemus

skies. Designed to achieve aerial supremacy at high altitudes,
the psychic pilots of these aircraft duel not with blades but with
batteries of missiles and rapid-firing cannons.

GREY KNIGHTS STORMTALON GUNSHIP
Stormtalon Gunships are highly manoeuvrable aircraft as versatile
in role as in their choice of target. Often running escort duties for
larger craft, they hunt down warp-spawned foes. Using vectored
afterburners, their pilots unleash ground attacks, saturating
teleportation zones with fire and clearing them for their brothers.
