IMPERIAL KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES
Imperial Knights fight by a stringent set of codes to ensure that in addition to defeating the enemy, honour is
always upheld.
CODE CHIVALRIC
If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, at the
end of the Read Mission Objectives step, you must
select one of the Oaths below to be active for your
army. Models from your army with this ability gain the
associated Oath ability, and you gain the associated
Deed to complete.
If, at the start of any of your Command phases,
your selected Oath’s Deed is completed, your army
becomes Honoured for the rest of the battle and
you gain 3CP (you can only gain CP in this way once
per battle).
LAY LOW THE TYRANT
■ Oath Ability: Each time this model is selected to
shoot or fight, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a
Wound roll of 1.
■ Deed: This deed is completed if the enemy
Warlord is destroyed.
RECLAIM THE REALM
■ Oath Ability: Add 1" to this model’s Move
characteristic and add 1 to Advance and Charge rolls
made for this model.
■ Deed: This deed is completed if you control one
or more objective markers in your opponent’s
deployment zone.
BONDSMAN ABILITIES
Some Questoris models have a Bondsman ability,
tagged with the word ‘Bondsman’. In your Command
phase, one or more models from your army with a
Bondsman ability can use that ability. For each one
that does, select one friendly Armiger model within
12" of that model (you cannot select an Armiger
model that is already being affected by a Bondsman
ability). Until the start of your next Command phase,
both of those models (i.e. the model that just used its
Bondsman ability and the Armiger model you just
selected) are affected by that Bondsman ability.
SUPER-HEAVY WALKER
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal,
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there.
FREEBLADES
Freeblades often wander the galaxy, aiding the
armies of the Imperium against the xenos and
heretics who threaten the Emperor’s realm.
If every model in your army has the Imperium
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic
Imperial Knights model or up to 3 Armiger
models in your army, even if they do not have
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select
Army Faction step. None of these models
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be
given Enhancements.
IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, you can
use this Noble Lance Detachment rule.
INDOMITABLE HEROES
Gathered into a powerful formation known as a lance,
Imperial Knights and the Nobles who pilot them wage
their honour-driven assaults with renowned resilience
and bloody-minded determination.
All Imperial Knights models from your army have
the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If your army is Honoured,
those models have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.
If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Enhancements.
REVERED KNIGHT (AURA)
Never hesitating before tyrannical invaders, this
Knight is beheld as the very epitome of honour – a
monolithic incarnation of the Imperium. While they
stand, courage is inviolate and victory is assured.
Imperial Knights model only. While a friendly
Imperial Knights model is within 6" of the bearer,
improve that model’s Leadership characteristic by 1.
If your army is Honoured, increase the range of this
Aura ability to 12".
MYSTERIOUS GUARDIAN
Manifesting as though from nowhere, this Noble’s
titanic steed is an elemental force of vengeance
against the Emperor of Mankind’s foes. At battle’s end,
it disappears as mysteriously as it arrived.
Imperial Knights model only. The bearer has the
Deep Strike ability. Once per battle, at the end of
your opponent’s turn, if the bearer is not within
Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can fade
away. If it does, remove it from the battlefield then,
in the Reinforcements step of your subsequent
Movement phase, set it up anywhere on the
battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from
all enemy models. If the battle ends and the bearer is
not on the battlefield, it is destroyed.
MYTHIC HERO
This warrior is a legendary figure who embodies the
Code Chivalric, and tales of their deeds have spread
far and wide. To be a Bondsman to such a warrior is a
great honour indeed.
Questoris model with a Bondsman ability only. Each
time the bearer uses its Bondsman ability, you can
select one additional friendly Armiger model within
12" of the bearer that is not already being affected
by a Bondsman ability. Until the start of your next
Command phase, that model is also affected by that
Bondsman ability.
BANNER OF MACHARIUS
TRIUMPHANT
A gift from Lord Solar Macharius himself to honour the
noble houses that accompanied his crusade, legend
has it that this banner has never seen defeat: every
time a Knight has carried it to war, a great victory has
been won.
Imperial Knights model only. If you control an
objective marker at the end of your Command phase
and the bearer is within range of that objective
marker, that objective marker remains under your
control even if you have no models within range of it,
until your opponent controls it at the start or end of
any turn.
UNYIELDING PARAGON
This Knight is an unyielding army unto themselves,
capable of engaging entire enemy forces and holding
their ground, emerging through the fiercest firestorms
bloodied, but unbowed.
Questoris model only. Each time an attack is
allocated to the bearer, worsen the Armour Penetration
characteristic of that attack by 1.

ENHANCEMENTS

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Stratagems.
SHOULDER THE BURDEN
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
When faced with their darkest hour, knightly
Nobles rise to the challenge, for nothing
shall deter them from fulfilling their duty.
WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model
from your army that has lost one or
more wounds.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next
Command phase, improve your model’s
Move, Toughness, Save, Leadership and
Objective Control characteristics by 1 and
each time your model makes an attack,
add 1 to the Hit roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this
Stratagem once per battle. If your army
is Honoured, you can use this Stratagem
one additional time.
ROTATE ION SHIELDS
NOBLE LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Veteran Knight pilots can swiftly angle their
ion shields to better deflect incoming fire.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,
just after an enemy unit has selected
its targets.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
that Imperial Knights model has a 4+
invulnerable save against ranged attacks.
THUNDERSTOMP
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The Noble brings their Knight suit’s full
weight crashing down with the force of
an industrial piledriver. Few can survive
such a blow.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model
from your army that has not been
selected to fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
your model cannot target Monster or
Vehicle units, but all melee weapons
equipped by your model have the
[DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.
SQUIRES’ DUTY
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Under the scrutiny and judgement of their
Noble betters, Armiger pilots will redouble
their efforts, attacking as one to smash
aside their foes.
WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more Armiger models
from your army and one enemy unit
that is an eligible target for all of those
Armiger models.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
improve the Strength and Armour
Penetration characteristics of weapons
equipped by those Armiger models by
1. If your army is Honoured, until the
end of the phase, add 1 to the Damage
characteristic of those weapons as well.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Stratagems.
TROPHY CLAIM
NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Once a mighty foe is laid low, the
victorious Knight’s emitters blare its
triumph, announcing the glory brought
to the Imperium, but shame awaits those
who fail in such confrontations.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model
from your army that has not been
selected to shoot or fight this phase, and
one enemy Monster or Vehicle unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time your model makes an attack that
targets that enemy unit, add 1 to the
Wound roll. If your model destroys that
enemy unit this phase, you gain 1CP, but if
your model does not destroy that enemy
unit this phase, you cannot use this
Stratagem again for the rest of the battle.
VALIANT LAST STAND
NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Badly wounded, their Knight’s generator
on the verge of overload, still the Noble
fights on, drawing upon their reserves of
chivalric heroism to sell their life as dearly
as they can.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model
from your army that was just destroyed
and that is eligible to fight but has not
been selected to fight this phase. You can
use this Stratagem on that model even
though it was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Before rolling to see if this model
deals any mortal wounds as a result of its
Deadly Demise ability, it can fight; when
doing so, it is assumed to have 1 wound
remaining, or all its wounds remaining
if your army is Honoured. After it has
finished resolving its attacks, resolve its
Deadly Demise ability as normal.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target
Sir Hekhtur with this Stratagem.

and a powerful close combat weapon. Seasoned Nobles prize these
suits, their experience enabling them to get the best use from them.

Gallants are the most restless and combative of Knights, and

are aggressive, bold and difficult to restrain, and their pilots often
share these traits. As befitting their nature, they are armed almost
exclusively with close combat weapons.

USING SIR HEKHTUR
When your Canis Rex model is destroyed, Sir Hekhtur is
treated as a model disembarking from a destroyed Transport
– set him up within 3" of your Canis Rex model before it is
removed. Sir Hekhtur then uses the profile, wargear, abilities
and keywords shown on this side of the card, but cannot be
selected as the target of any of your Stratagems other than
Core Stratagems. Your Canis Rex unit is not considered to be
destroyed until Sir Hekhtur is also destroyed.
SIR HEKHTUR
Use this side of the card only after your Canis Rex model

Once a prisoner of the Iron Warriors, Sir Hekhtur resisted
agonising torture and escaped only through sheer faith,
determination and honour. Now he travels the galaxy,
liberating Imperial citizens enslaved by the forces of
the Arch-enemy.

CHAOS KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES
Where Chaos Knights tread, the skies grow
unnaturally dark and the dread of the warp permeates
the battlefield. None are immune to its shadowy
touch, for those it does not paralyse with fear
and despair are wracked with hallucinations and
driven mad.
HARBINGERS OF DREAD
If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, each model
from your army with this ability gains a bonus
depending on which Dread abilities are active for
your army (see below). Once a Dread ability is active
for your army, that ability applies until the end of
the battle.
BATTLE ROUND 1 ONWARDS
From the first battle round onwards, the Despair
ability is active for your army:
DESPAIR (AURA)
While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model,
each time that enemy unit takes a Battle-shock or
Leadership test, subtract 1 from that test.
BATTLE ROUND 3 ONWARDS
From the third battle round onwards, the Doom and
Darkness ability is active for your army:
DOOM AND DARKNESS
■ Each time this model makes an attack, if the target
is Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Wound roll.
■ Each time an attack targets this model, if the
attacking model’s unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1
from the Hit roll.
SUPER-HEAVY WALKER
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal,
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there.
DREADBLADES
Dreadblades often wander the galaxy, carving
a path of destruction and slaughtering foes
alongside other forces of Chaos as and when
they will.
If every model in your army has the Chaos
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic
Chaos Knights model or up to 3 War Dog
models in your army, even if they do not have
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select
Army Faction step. None of these models
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be
given Enhancements.
CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, you can use
this Traitoris Lance Detachment rule.
FORGED IN TERROR (AURA)
Chaos Knights are servants of shadow and terror;
wherever they stride, fear and madness spread.
In the Battle-shock step of your opponent’s Command
phase, if an enemy unit that is below its Starting
Strength is within 12" of a Chaos Knights model
from your army, that enemy unit must take a Battleshock test. For the purposes of this ability, if a unit
has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to be
below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or
more wounds.
Designer’s Note: This means that all enemy units
within range of this Aura ability that have lost one or
more models must take a Battle-shock test in your
opponent’s Command phase, not just those that are
Below Half-strength.
If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Enhancements.
LORD OF DREAD
This tyrannical Knight is the epitome of dread power,
instilling as much fear in their minions as they do over
the enemy, ensuring unwavering obedience.
Chaos Knights model only. At the start of the
Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within
Engagement Range of the bearer; that enemy unit
must take a Battle-shock test.
AURA OF TERROR
This towering Knight is wreathed in tendrils of warp
energy that caress the minds of any enemy who
draws near, driving those touched into a state of
abject fear. Wherever this Knight treads, this aura of
terror permeates and corrupts the land until it can
be cleansed.
Chaos Knights model only. If you control an
objective marker at the end of your Command phase,
and the bearer is within range of that objective
marker, that objective marker is said to be Tainted
and remains under your control even if you have no
models within range of it, until your opponent controls
it at the start or end of any turn. In addition, while an
objective marker is Tainted and under your control
and the Despair Dread ability is active for your army,
that objective marker has the Despair Dread ability as
if it was a Chaos Knights model from your army (so
subtract 1 from Battle-shock and Leadership tests
taken for enemy units within 12" of it).
THE TRAITOR’S MARK
The dark deeds and bloodstained heraldry of this
Chaos Knight are whispered far and wide. Rumours
spread that to confront it is to face a painful death.
Each blazon borne upon its hull proclaims the unholy
atrocities committed by the bearer, and even to look
upon these loathsome sigils is to be gripped by
unnatural terror and beset by swarming nightmares.
Chaos Knights model only. The Doom and Darkness
ability is active for the bearer from the first battle
round onwards, instead of from the third.
PANOPLY OF THE CURSED KNIGHTS
Borne within an unmarked casket by an order of
silent Idolators, this collection of tattered pennants,
chain-strung charms and armour scraps represent
the last remains of the Knight Carnivus Grymm. It
is said that festooning one’s Knight suit with these
charms instils the legendary fortitude of that doomed
war engine. Yet it is whispered that doing so also
invites the attentions of the same dread curse that
eventually led to Carnivus Grymm’s ghastly end.
Chaos Knights model only. Each time an attack is
made against the bearer, subtract 1 from the Armour
Penetration characteristic of that attack.

victims then attack in a ferocious mass.
WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more War Dog units from
your army and one enemy unit that is an
eligible target for each of those selected
War Dog units.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
the selected War Dog units can only
target that enemy unit, but all weapons
equipped by those War Dog models gain
the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. In addition,
if that enemy unit is Battle-shocked, until
the end of the phase, each time a selected
War Dog model makes an attack against
that enemy unit, an unmodified Hit roll of
5+ scores a Critical Hit.
DISDAIN FOR THE WEAK
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Chaos Knight pilots refuse to yield while
foes remain to be slain, disdainfully
ignoring those who succumb to fear.
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from
your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your
model has the Feel No Pain 6+ ability, and
the Feel No Pain 5+ ability against attacks
made by Battle-shocked models.
PTERRORSHADES
TRAITORIS LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Shrieking with ghoulish hunger, daemonic
entities descend in a tatterwinged
whirlwind to rend apart the souls of those
enemies who show even a moment’s fear.
The soul-raptors tear apart their victims’
animus and, as they feed, this life force
is channelled to regenerate the battle
damage or heal the pilot of the Knight in
which these creatures roost.
WHEN: Any phase, just after an enemy
unit fails a Battle-shock test.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from
your army that is within 12" of that
enemy unit.
EFFECT: Roll six D6. For each 4+, that
enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound and
this model regains up to 1 lost wound.

TRAITORIS LANCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
The War Dogs of the Chaos Knights are
more terrified of their lords than they
are the enemy, and they heed their
masters well, for they know the price of
disobedience or disloyalty.
WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Abhorrent model from your
army and up to three War Dog models
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next
Command phase, those War Dog models
count as being within range of any Aura
abilities that Abhorrent model has.

Like dark phantoms, some Chaos
Knights can move through solid walls
without hindrance.
WHEN: Your Movement phase or your

Ectoplasmic blood surges hot through
glowing conduits as the Chaos Knight
feeds power to its shield emitters.

that Chaos Knights model has a 4+
invulnerable save against ranged attacks.
