CHAOS SPACE MARINES
ARMY RULES
Beseeching the Chaos Gods with fanatical fervour,
the profane champions of the Heretic Astartes pray
for diabolic boons, promising the vilest of offerings in
return for their power.
DARK PACTS
If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, each time a
unit with this ability is selected to shoot or fight, it can
make a Dark Pact. If it does, select one of the following
abilities for that unit’s weapons to gain until the end
of the phase:
■ [LETHAL HITS]
■ [SUSTAINED HITS 1]
Each time a unit makes a Dark Pact, after it has
resolved its attacks, it must take a Leadership test; if
that test is failed, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
THE LOST AND THE DAMNED
Some traitors have given themselves entirely
to the service of the Dark Gods, and they
are so lost to damnation that they barely
resemble the warriors they once were.
If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes,
you can include any of the following
units in your army, and when you do so
their Faction keywords are replaced with
Heretic Astartes:
■ Khorne Berzerkers (see World Eaters)
■ Rubric Marines (see Thousand Sons)
■ Plague Marines (see Death Guard)
The combined points value of such units you
can include in your army depends on the
battle size, as follows:
■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts
CHAOS SPACE MARINES – SLAVES TO DARKNESS
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, you can use this Slaves to Darkness
Detachment rule.
MARKS OF CHAOS
When mustering your army, each time you select a Heretic Astartes unit
to include in your army, if that unit is not an Epic Hero and does not already
have one or more of the keywords listed below, you must select one of the
keywords listed below for that unit to gain (note which units gain which
keywords in this way on your Army Roster). Each time a unit with one of
these keywords makes a Dark Pact, it gains the associated ability below until
the end of the phase.
KEYWORD ABILITY
Khorne Blood Fury: In the Fight phase, if this unit’s weapons
gained the [LETHAL HITS] ability this phase as the
result of a Dark Pact, each time a model in this unit
makes an attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores
a Critical Hit.
Tzeentch Warpfire: In the Shooting phase, if this unit’s
weapons gained the [LETHAL HITS] ability this phase
as the result of a Dark Pact, each time a model in this
unit makes an attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+
scores a Critical Hit.
Nurgle Spreading Sickness: In the Shooting phase, if this
unit’s weapons gained the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability
this phase as the result of a Dark Pact, each time a
model in this unit makes an attack, an unmodified
Hit roll of 5+ scores a Critical Hit.
Slaanesh Excessive Cruelty: In the Fight phase, if this unit’s
weapons gained the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability this
phase as the result of a Dark Pact, each time a model
in this unit makes an attack, an unmodified Hit roll of
5+ scores a Critical Hit.
Chaos Undivided Glory to Chaos: Each time a model in this unit makes
an attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.
RESTRICTIONS
■ You cannot select the Khorne keyword for a Psyker unit to gain.
■ A Character unit with the Leader ability can only be attached to a
Bodyguard unit if both of those units share one of the same keywords from
the list above.

STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Slaves to Darkness Detachment rule, you can use these Slaves to Darkness Stratagems.
INFERNAL RITES
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
With gruesome offerings and ritualised
promises, the Chaos Space Marines seek
the protection of their infernal masters.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets your unit, worsen
the Armour Penetration characteristic of
that attack by 1.
PROFANE ZEAL
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Fervent mortal followers flock to the
champions of Chaos, damning their souls
seeking promises of dark power.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the
Fight phase.
TARGET: : One Heretic Astartes unit from
your army that has not been selected to
shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes an
attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a
Wound roll of 1. If your unit is a Chaos
Undivided unit, you can instead re-roll
the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound
roll for that attack.
ETERNAL HATE
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Heretic Astartes are fuelled by hate, a searing
spite that burns fiercely within them unto the
very moment of death. Even as their life force
pours from terrible wounds, this loathing can
drive them to fight on in a second wind of
wrath. Those Heretic Astartes in thrall to the
Blood God feel this enmity to an even greater
extent than others, exploding with violence
just as the enemy think they have finally
ended them.
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from
your army that was selected as the target of
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that
model has not fought this phase, roll one
D6, adding 1 to the result if it is a Khorne
unit: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. That
destroyed model can fight after the attacking
model’s unit has finished making its attacks,
and is then removed from play.

SKINSHIFT
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
With the Dark Gods and the powers of the
warp on their side, Chaos Space Marines
can cheat death altogether. Their foes
look on in horror as killing wounds knit
themselves together in a cacophony
of hideous cracks and squelches and
shattered armour reforms. After such a
blessing, the Heretic Astartes are both
something far greater, and far less, than
what they once were.
WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from
your army.
EFFECT: One model in your unit regains
up to 3 lost wounds. In addition, if your
unit is a Tzeentch unit below its Starting
Strength, one destroyed model (excluding
Character models) is returned to your
unit with its full wounds remaining.
UNNATURAL SWIFTNESS
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC
PLOY STRATAGEM
Some Heretic Astartes appear to move
with a speed that should be impossible,
weapons and bodies seemingly moving
from one place to another in the blink of
an eye.
WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in
a turn in which it Fell Back. In addition, if
your unit is a Slaanesh unit, until the end
of the turn, your unit is eligible to shoot
and declare a charge in a turn in which
it Advanced.
DARK OBSCURATION
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC PLOY
STRATAGEM
Choking fogs echoing with the screams
of tortured souls; dense clouds of bloated
flies; deluges of bloody rain; whirlwinds of
coruscating flames blazing in a thousand
hues. Such warp-born phenomena can
appear on the battlefield in an instant,
and disappear just as quickly. All serve
to obscure the Heretic Astartes from their
terrified foes.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,
just after an enemy unit has selected
its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your
unit has the Stealth ability. In addition, if
your unit is a Nurgle unit, until the end of
the phase, your unit can only be selected
as the target of a ranged attack if the
attacking model is within 12".

TALISMAN OF BURNING BLOOD
This talisman constantly drips with thick, bubbling
gore. The air around it is so heavy with the charnel
stench of the slaughterhouse that it imbues the
bearer’s limbs with supernatural ferocity and strength
– a welcome boon to those eager to claim the
worthiest skulls for Khorne.
Heretic Astartes Khorne model only. Add 1 to the
Attacks and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s
melee weapons. Each time the bearer’s unit makes
a Dark Pact, until the end of the phase, add D3 to the
Attacks and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s
melee weapons instead.
EYE OF TZEENTCH
The Eye of Tzeentch is a relic that has been exposed
to wild psychic energies for ten millennia. Champions
who stare into the artefact’s unblinking depths can
glean the secrets of the warp.
Heretic Astartes Tzeentch model only. Each time
the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, take a Leadership
test for the bearer: if that test is passed, you gain 1CP.
ORBS OF UNLIFE
Within these glassy spheres lurks a diluted life-eater
virus. Although quick to burn out when the sphere is
broken, everything nearby not touched by Nurgle’s
bountiful blessings – flesh, armour and bone – finds
itself consumed by the ravaging viral strain..
Heretic Astartes Nurgle model only. At the end
of the Fight phase, roll one D6 for every enemy unit
within 6" of the bearer, adding 1 to the result if the
bearer’s unit made a Dark Pact that phase: on a 4+,
that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
INTOXICATING ELIXIR
This dispenser is filled with a self-replenishing liquid
that is pumped into the bearer’s bloodstream by
the pint. Some say the liquid, which grants those
that partake of it unholy physical power, is a nectar
distilled from Slaanesh’s own pleasure gardens, for
while it heightens the bearer’s abilities, foes caught
in its soporific fumes are paralysed with terror
and ecstasy.
Heretic Astartes Slaanesh model only. The bearer
has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. Each time the bearer
shoots or fights, if the bearer’s unit made a Dark
Pact this phase, after the bearer has resolved those
attacks, select one enemy unit that was hit by one or
more of those attacks; that enemy unit must take a
Battle-shock test.
LIBER HERETICUS
This cursed tome contains forbidden lore said to
have been absorbed while the artefact consumed the
minds of those who risked reading it. One with the
strength to tame it can use it to empower their rituals.
Heretic Astartes Chaos Undivided model only.
Each time the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, that
unit’s weapons gain the [LETHAL HITS] and [SUSTAINED
HITS 1] ability until the end of the phase, instead of
just gaining one of those abilities.

Insane Bravery Stratagem for 0CP, even if another unit from
your army has already been targeted with that Stratagem this
phase. Each time you use this ability, one Bodyguard model
in that unit is destroyed.
Mutated Bodyguard: While this unit contains a Traitor
Ogryn model, Character models in this unit have the
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

TRAITOR ENFORCER
Whether petty tyrants who killed their way to dominance, or former
officers brought low through corruption, Enforcers are now sadistic
disciplinarians amongst the Militarum Traitoris. Some cement their
position by exploiting savage Traitor Ogryns as living shields, crude
line-breakers and added muscle to help impose their violent rule.
