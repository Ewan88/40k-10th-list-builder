ORKS
ARMY RULE
The infamous war cry of the Orks is known and
feared throughout the galaxy. When it echoes across
the battlefield, bellowed from hundreds or even
thousands of greenskin mouths, even the most
stalwart warriors fear the onslaught to come.
WAAAGH!
If your Army Faction is Orks, once per battle, at the
start of the battle round, you can call a Waaagh! If you
do, until the start of the next battle round:
■ Orks units from your army are eligible to declare a
charge in a turn in which they Advanced.
■ Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics
of melee weapons equipped by Orks models from
your army.
■ Orks models from your army have a 5+
invulnerable save.
ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Orks, you can use this
Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule.
GET STUCK IN
Once an Ork gets stuck into hand-to-hand combat,
they quickly overwhelm their enemies through
sheer ferocity.
Melee weapons equipped by Orks models from your
army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.
ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
STRATAGEMS
If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Stratagems.
CAREEN!
WAAAGH! TRIBE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
If their vehicle is on its last legs, any Ork
worth their steering wheel will aim its
blazing remains into the nearest cluster
of enemies. The ensuing explosions never
fail to raise a rousing cheer from nearby
Ork onlookers.
WHEN: Any phase, just after an Orks
Vehicle unit from your army with the
Deadly Demise ability is destroyed.
TARGET:That destroyed Orks Vehicle
unit, if you roll a 6 for its Deadly Demise
ability. You can use this Stratagem on that
unit even though it was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal or
Fall Back move before its Deadly Demise
ability is resolved, and before any
embarked units perform an Emergency
Disembarkation. When making this move,
your unit can move over enemy units
(excluding Monsters and Vehicles) as if
they were not there.
ORKS IS NEVER BEATEN
WAAAGH! TRIBE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
So resilient is Ork physiology – and so
slow are Orks on the uptake – that even
killing wounds can take a while to register.
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army
that was selected as the target of one or
more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if
that model has not fought this phase, do
not remove it from play. The destroyed
model can fight after the attacking
model’s unit has finished making attacks,
and is then removed from play.
UNBRIDLED CARNAGE
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
When Orks get stuck into the foe, the
carnage is wonderful to behold, at least
for other Orks.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army
that has not been selected to fight
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an Orks model in your unit makes a
melee attack, an unmodified hit roll of 5+
scores a Critical Hit.

’ARD AS NAILS
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Even the lowliest Ork Boy can take a
tremendous amount of punishment before
being slain.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army
that was selected as the target of one or
more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets your unit, subtract
1 from the Wound roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select
a Vehicle or Gretchin unit for
this Stratagem.
MOB RULE
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The more Orks that gather in one place the
more the Waaagh! energy flows, and the
more fearless they all become.
WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Mob unit from your army that
contains 10 or more models and is not
Below Half-strength.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, while
a friendly Orks Infantry unit is within 6"
of that Mob unit, that Orks Infantry unit
can still be selected as the target of your
Stratagems even if it is Battle-shocked.
’ERE WE GO
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
Even lumbering Orks can put on a
surprising turn of speed when the promise
of a good face-to-face fight is in the offing.
Once a horde of Orks get a sight of the foe,
nothing can stop them.
WHEN: Start of your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Orks Infantry unit from
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, add 2
to Advance and Charge rolls made for
your unit.

likes to be the first into the fray.
Orks model only. While the bearer is leading a
unit, add 2" to the Move characteristic of models in
that unit.
HEADWOPPA’S KILLCHOPPA
Grand Warboss Headwoppa and his tribe were last
seen charging headlong into a horde of Khornate
daemons, but legend speaks of a blood-slick choppa
that still turns up occasionally. Though this weapon
looks normal, a dark voice is said to growl in the mind
of its wielder, driving them on to ever greater excesses
of violence.
Orks model only. Melee weapons equipped by the
bearer that do not have the [EXTRA ATTACKS] ability
have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.
KUNNIN’ BUT BRUTAL
Feigning weakness, this greenskin allows his foes to
close in before delivering a brutal flurry of attacks.
Orks model only. While the bearer is leading a unit,
that unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a
turn in which it Fell Back.
SUPA-CYBORK BODY
The original owner of this one-of-a-kind endoskeleton
became the envy of every Warboss around, and was
soon gutted and stripped for parts by a stronger
rival. The Supa-Cybork Body has been retransplanted
several times since then, filling its new owner with
confidence, resilience and a belated hope that the
Painboyz gave it a quick clean before shoving it back
in place…
Orks model only. The bearer has the
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

Plummeting from his kustom fighta-bommer at the head of his
infamous Vulcha Boyz, Boss Zagstruk hits the enemy like a four
hundred pound rocket-propelled missile of pure, belligerent fury.
Amidst the roar of his blitz missiles and the crunch of bone beneath
his cybork foot-klaws, bloody havoc ensues.

stampede towards the enemy lines, relying on their numbers and

The burna is a cutting torch intended for slicing up battlefield

an enemy’s armour at close quarters, or, with a twist of its nozzle, can
instead belch a tongue of roaring flame over the foe. Needless to say,
the most pyromaniacally inclined Orks delight in doing both.

wurrtower; butcha boyz; savage horns and hooves;
saw blades.
TRANSPORT
This model has a transport capacity of 11 Beast Snagga
Infantry models.
KILL RIG
The Kill Rig’s stikka kannon fires rokkit-harpoons big enough to
wrangle battle tanks. Its ’eavy lobba hits with ground-quaking force,
and the tramplasquig that tows this land barge can flatten a fortress
gate. Yet it is the Wurrboy atop his wurrtower that both the enemy and
the Beast Snaggas themselves fear the most.

Surgically wiring grots into combat walkers is risky: the runty loons
tend to go on a bit of a power trip, hazardous to every Ork that ever
treated them badly. On the other hand, their ability to shoot straight

with very big knives and their application to people’s backs, throats

PAINBOSS
The Painboss specialises in both the surgical care and
cyber-augmentation of squigs, and of those suffering squig-related
injuries. So as to provide their services ‘on the hoof’, Painbosses
augment themselves with piston-driven soopa-legz, monowheels and
the like – the better to deliver high-speed doktorin’.

The traditional tools of the Painboy help them to patch up even the

these gruesome surgical klaws, rippy saws and fat syringes also
serve as an expedient means of dismembering the enemy with – if not
surgical precision – at least a great deal of enthusiasm!

These vehicles started out as mobile food wagons, but became

with a propensity for detonating like an artillery shell.

MEKBOY WORKSHOP
Mekboyz are more than happy to raise new workshops
mid-battle, throwing the structures together from the wreck and
ruin lying all about. Enemies watch in bemused horror as these
ad hoc structures swarm with activity and start churning out
upgraded and kustomised war engines right before their eyes!
