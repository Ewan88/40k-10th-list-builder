SPACE WOLVES – CHAMPIONS OF RUSS
DETACHMENT RULE
The Space Wolves are a savage Space Marine Chapter
of merciless hunters. They hail from the icy death
world of Fenris and strive to emulate the strength,
cunning and howling ferocity of their Primarch:
Leman Russ, the Wolf King. In their pursuits of the
enemies of Mankind across the Sea of Stars, the
Space Wolves employ the advanced technology and
deadly weapons of the Adeptus Astartes under a skin
of seemingly feral barbarity. With audacious boasts,
the taking of impetuous risks and the joyful roars
of warriors born, the Space Wolves are a Chapter of
heroes who wage war without fear or doubt, each
seeking to forge a saga worthy of immortalisation.
If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can
use this Champions of Russ Detachment rule.

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The belligerency and transhuman
physiologies of the Adeptus Astartes
make them unyielding foes.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an attack targets a model in your
unit, worsen the Armour Penetration
characteristic of that attack by 1.
GO FOR THE THROAT
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
With the scent of blood in the air and the
rushing joy of battle surging through
every true warrior’s hearts, even the
greatest quarry can be brought down.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army that has not been selected to
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
improve the Armour Penetration
characteristic of melee weapons
equipped by models in your unit by 1.
If the Saga of the Beastslayer has been
completed by your army, until the end
of the phase, such weapons have the
[LANCE] ability as well.
RUNIC WARDS
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – WARGEAR STRATAGEM
Imbued as they are with the cunning
psychic might of the Rune Priests,
shamanistic totems, tattoos and fetishes
are a potent shield against baleful attacks
and the foul sorcery of witches.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking

DEATH HOWL
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Having stalked their prey or run them
to ground, all that remains is to go for
the enemy’s weakest points, to rip them
apart in a furious bloodletting. Onlookers
are stricken with terror at the bloody
spectacle, an instant before the sons of
Russ pounce upon them.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from
your army that destroyed one or more
enemy units this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,
each time a model in your unit makes
a Consolidation move, it can move up
to 6" instead of up to 3", provided your
unit ends that Consolidation move in
Unit Coherency and within Engagement
Range of one or more enemy units. In
addition, if the Saga of Majesty has been
completed by your army, each enemy
unit within 6" of your unit when it ends
that Consolidation move must take a
Battle-shock test.
WARRIOR PRIDE
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
The greatest champions amongst the
sons of Russ must take the fight to the
enemy, leading by example to uphold the
honour of their Chapter.
WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes
Character model from your army.
EFFECT: Select one Saga that has not
yet been completed by your army.
Until the end of the turn, models in your
Character’s unit have the benefit of the
selected Saga as if it had been completed
by your army.
RELENTLESS ASSAULT
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Once their blades and claws run red with
the enemy’s blood, nothing will hold the
savage sons of Russ back from new prey.
WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army
makes a Fall Back or Advance move.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit
is eligible to shoot even though it Fell Back
or Advanced this phase. If the Saga of the
Warrior Born has been completed by your
army, until the end of the turn, your unit is
also eligible to declare a charge.

THE PELT OF BALEWOLF
The pelts of wolves are plentiful trophies amongst
the heroes of Fenris. However, some of these mantles
are rare and steeped in legend, belonging to one
of the near-mythical Blackmaned wolves. The Pelt
of Balewolf came from a giant of its massive kind.
Even now, when the name of its heroic slayer is
barely recalled, Balewolf ’s raw spirit still permeates
the long-dead creature’s pelt, a bestial aura that
reaches into primitive fear centres. Even the mighty
instinctively tremble before the wearer, sensing the
presence of a terrifying alpha predator.
Adeptus Astartes model only. At the start of the Fight
phase, each enemy unit within Engagement Range of
the bearer must take a Battle-shock test.
BLACK DEATH
The sagas of Torvald Fangbreaker, of Gerd the Bloody
and many others detail the sickening monsters and
fell champions slain by Black Death. They tell of how
the runic enchantments etched into the ebon weapon
glow darkly in battle, transforming the bearer into a
relentless killing machine.
Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s
melee weapons have the [ANTI-MONSTER 4+] and
[ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] abilities.
WOLF TAIL TALISMAN
Although seen by the sons of Russ as tokens of
luck and protection against evil, wolf tail talismans
are regarded by most outside the Chapters of Russ’
genetic legacy as trinkets of mere superstition. Yet
whether through the power of the bearer’s belief,
some attribute inherent in the creatures they are
taken from or some stranger reason, these talismans
appear to bestow the warrior with a measure of
protection against malicious attacks.
Adeptus Astartes model only. Each time an attack
is allocated to the bearer, subtract 1 from the Damage
characteristic of that attack.
FROST WEAPON
Amongst the most prized weapons of the sons of
Russ – himself the Lord of Winter and War – these
blisteringly cold weapons are specially crafted by
a master Iron Priest. Some are wrought from the
razor-sharp fangs of the Ice Kraken, while others
are shards of energised diamond, giving them the
appearance of blades forged from purest ice.
Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s melee
weapons have the [PRECISION] ability, and the
Strength and Armour Penetration characteristics of
those weapons are improved by 1.

UNIT COMPOSITION
■ 1 Cyberwolf
This model is equipped with: teeth and claws.
LEADER
This model can be attached to the following unit:
■ Fenrisian Wolves
You must attach this model to the above unit, even if Canis
Wolfborn has been attached to it. If you do, and that
Bodyguard unit is destroyed, the Leader units attached to it
become separate units, with their original Starting Strengths.
If it is not possible to attach this model to a unit, it does not
take part in the battle and counts as having been destroyed.
WOLFKIN
This model cannot be your Warlord and cannot be
given Enhancements.
CYBERWOLF
If critically injured, the largest and most ferocious Fenrisian Wolves
are rebuilt, mechanically augmented by the Chapter’s Iron Priests.
These Cyberwolves may return to their old pack, to lead their kin and
hunt with bionically enhanced muscles and steel fangs. Exhibiting
such strength, flesh-and-blood wolves instinctively follow them.

WOLF SCOUTS
Wolf Scouts are brooding stalkers and taciturn killers, at ease prowling
behind enemy lines or at a battle’s edges. Commonly experienced
battle-brothers rather than neophytes, Wolf Scouts employ patience
and guile in their roles as reconnaissance experts and forward
hunters, sniffing out isolated foes and falling upon them with fury.

SPACE WOLVES VENERABLE DREADNOUGHT
Venerable Dreadnoughts are priceless relics steeped in centuries of
battle. The ancient warriors at the heart of each are living legends of
the Space Wolves, with wisdom as deep as the ocean and intuition as
sharp as krakens’ teeth. Awoken from dormancy, they fight as lords of
battle, seemingly stepping from the sagas to kill in the name of Russ.
