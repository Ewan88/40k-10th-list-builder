THOUSAND SONS
ARMY RULE
The Thousand Sons channel their arcane power through battlefield ritual, beseeching the Changer of the Ways to
gift them forbidden knowledge or ravage their foes with warpfire and mutation.
CABAL OF SORCERERS
If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, at the end of your Command phase, each model from your army with
this ability that is on the battlefield (excluding Battle-shocked models) generates you a number of Cabal points
equal to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a model with the Cabal of Sorcerers 2 ability would generate you
2 Cabal points). The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool. During the battle round, you can use
Rituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do
not have enough Cabal points for a Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase. At the
start of your next Command phase, your Cabal points pool resets to zero. Each time you use a Ritual, select one
Thousand Sons Psyker model from your army, then apply that Ritual’s effect using that Psyker.
WEAVER OF FATES (PSYCHIC)
2 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once during
that phase, when a saving throw is failed for a friendly
Thousand Sons model whose unit is within 18" of
this Psyker, you can re-roll that saving throw.
TEMPORAL SURGE (PSYCHIC)
5 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase.
Select one friendly Thousand Sons unit within 18"
of this Psyker; unless that unit is within Engagement
Range of one or more enemy units, it can make a
Normal move. If it does, that unit is not eligible to
declare a charge this turn.
ECHOES FROM THE WARP (PSYCHIC)
6 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once this
phase, you can select this Psyker’s unit as the target
of a Stratagem for 0CP, even if you have already used
that Stratagem this phase.
DOOMBOLT (PSYCHIC)
7 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase.
Select one enemy unit within 18" of and visible to
this Psyker and roll one D6: on a 1, that enemy unit
suffers D3 mortal wounds; on a 2-5, it suffers D3+3
mortal wounds; on a 6, it suffers D3+6 mortal wounds.
TWIST OF FATE (PSYCHIC)
9 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Select one
enemy unit within 18" of and visible to this Psyker;
until the end of the phase, armour saving throws
cannot be made for models in that unit.
THOUSAND SONS – CULT OF MAGIC
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, you can use
this Cult of Magic Detachment rule.
KINDRED SORCERY
For an instant, the chanting voices of the Thousand
Sons achieve perfect synchronisation, words of
malign incantation rolling out like the peal of
some cursed bell amidst the empyrean.
In your Command phase, you can select
one of the abilities listed below to
take effect until the start of your next
Command phase.
MALEVOLENT CHARGE
Psychic weapons equipped by
Thousand Sons models from your army
have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

PSYCHIC DOMINION
CULT OF MAGIC – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
To pit one’s own psychic prowess against
the sorcerous might of the Thousand Sons
is to be trapped, helpless and screaming,
within one’s own mind.

unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Thousand Sons unit from
your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.

attacks made against your unit with
Psychic weapons have the [HAZARDOUS]
ability and all models in your unit have

Psychic Attacks.
DESTINED BY FATE
CULT OF MAGIC – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
The Architect of Fate has great designs
for his pawns, which do not include their
untimely demise just yet…

failed for a Thousand Sons Psyker model
from your army.
TARGET: That Psyker model.
EFFECT: Change the Damage
characteristic of that attack to 0.
DEVASTATING SORCERY
CULT OF MAGIC – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
This warrior’s veins burn with raw
sorcery. The sheer unstoppable might
of their conjurations is such that, when
unleashed with destructive intent, there
is little that can prevent them from
devastating manifestation.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Thousand Sons Psyker
unit from your army that has not been
selected to shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes a Psychic
Attack, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you
can re-roll the Wound roll.
ENSORCELLED INFUSION

Utilising the fell powers of the warp,
Thousand Sons Sorcerers infuse their

SORCEROUS MIGHT
CULT OF MAGIC – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
The most powerful sorcerers of the
Thousand Sons are battle-psykers who
can, if the need is dire enough, siphon a
sliver of their corrupted souls into their
eldritch assaults to temporarily boost
their potency.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Thousand Sons Psyker
unit from your army that has not been
selected to shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, add 9"
to the range of Psychic weapons equipped
by your unit.
WARP SIGHT
CULT OF MAGIC – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
With their tainted souls melded as one in
the warp, what one champion of the cabal
sees, all their fellows see also.
WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Thousand Sons Psyker unit
from your army and one enemy unit that
is visible to that unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a friendly Thousand Sons Psyker
model makes an attack with a Psychic
weapon that targets that enemy unit,
that attack has the [INDIRECT FIRE] and
[IGNORES COVER] abilities.
1CP 2CP
If you are using the Cult of Magic Detachment rule, you can use these Cult of Magic Enhancements.
LORD OF FORBIDDEN LORE
This sorcerer has committed many a grimoire and
unholy tome to memory, giving him unparalleled
knowledge of hexes, curses and destructive rites.
Thousand Sons Psyker model only. The bearer can
be selected to use a Ritual even if another Psyker
from your army has already been selected to use that
Ritual this phase.
ATHENAEAN SCROLLS
Ahriman consumed the knowledge contained in
the Athenaeum of Kallimakus long ago, but not all
of the Athenaeum’s founders were slain when their
repository of knowledge was destroyed. Some of their
lore has since been transcribed to keep an echo of
that great library in existence. One who possesses
these texts has access to techniques that make his
spells exceptionally potent.
Thousand Sons Psyker model only. In your
Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield and
is not Battle-shocked, it generates you 1 additional
Cabal point this phase.
UMBRALEFIC CRYSTAL
By siphoning the perpetual gloom from the location
where the cursed planet Mangel III once existed in
realspace, a cabal of sorcerers from the Cult of Magic
created the Umbralefic Crystal. One in command of
this powerful relic can use its energies to temporarily
fold space, creating a gate of sorcerous translocation
through which he or his allies can step.
Thousand Sons model only. Once per battle, in your
Command phase, you can remove the bearer’s unit
from the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements
step of your next Movement phase, set that unit back
up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9"
horizontally away from all enemy models.
ARCANE VORTEX
This ritualistic locus is formed from the matter of
arcane objects, their substance broken down at
a molecular level and added to a nexus of energy
surrounding the creator. When battle is joined, the
sorcerer draws upon this power, all the better to
unleash warp-fuelled destruction upon the enemy.
Thousand Sons model only. Add 1 to the Strength
and Damage characteristics of Psychic weapons
equipped by the bearer.

assault weapon.
THOUSAND SONS CULTISTS
Countless mortals offer up their souls to Tzeentch in the hopes of
reward. For most, this comes in the unenviable form of desperate
battle against their former oppressors, being hurled into the enemy’s
ranks as fodder – sacrificed en masse upon the altar of the battlefield
by their uncaring Thousand Sons masters.

THOUSAND SONS DAEMON PRINCE
The Daemon Princes of the Thousand Sons are potent sorcerers and
monstrous warriors both, terrifying in their martial might. Moreover,
their mere presence bends the weave of fate into forms more fortuitous
for their designs, ensuring that the warriors they lead to battle strike
their enemies down with unnatural precision.
