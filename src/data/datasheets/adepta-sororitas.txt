ADEPTA SORORITAS
ARMY RULE
The Battle Sisters of the Adepta Sororitas bear the holy weaponry with which the Emperor’s legions conquered
the galaxy, and illuminate the faithless in lethal volleys from the holy trinity of bolter, flamer and melta weapons.
It is said the Emperor’s benediction touches each of these warriors, manifesting as a nimbus of holy light in
which his power is revealed in miraculous deeds of fortitude and divine strength.
ACTS OF FAITH
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, each unit from your army with this ability can perform one Act of Faith
per phase. This is done using Miracle dice.
GAINING MIRACLE DICE
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you gain 1
Miracle dice:
■ At the start of each turn.
■ Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your
army is destroyed.
Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The
number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This
value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule
specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice
to one side – this is your Miracle dice pool.
PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITH
Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your
army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one
or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can
perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the
dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that
dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a
Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can
be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is
not rolled; instead the value of the selected Miracle
dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as
an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules
purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for
substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions
have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice
from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining,
unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You
can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of
Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:
■ Advance roll
■ Battle-shock test
■ Charge roll
■ Damage roll
■ Hit roll
■ Saving throw
■ Wound roll
Example: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s
Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from
your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was
4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined
by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would
be D6+4).
ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
DETACHMENT RULE
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you can
use this Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule.
THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS
The blood of martyrs is the life force of the Imperium.
So do the tenets of this Order joyously proclaim, and
in its warriors’ darkest hour does the sacrifice of their
fallen Sisters shine brightest.
Each time an Adepta Sororitas model from your
army makes an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll if that
model’s unit is below its Starting Strength, and add 1
to the Wound roll, as well, if that model’s unit is Below
Half-strength. For the purposes of this ability, if a
unit has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to
be below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or
more wounds.
If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Stratagems.
DIVINE INTERVENTION
HALLOWED MARTYRS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM
Sometimes, a brush with death is so close
the only explanation is divine intervention.
WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas
Character unit from your army that
was just destroyed. You can use this
Stratagem on that unit even though it was
just destroyed.
EFFECT: Discard 1-3 Miracle dice. At the
end of the phase, set the last destroyed
model from your unit back up on the
battlefield, as close as possible to
where it was destroyed and not within
Engagement Range of any enemy models.
That model is set back up with a number
of wounds remaining equal to the number
of Miracle dice you discarded.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select Saint
Celestine as the target of this Stratagem.
You cannot select the same Character
as the target of this Stratagem more than
once per battle.
LIGHT OF THE EMPEROR
HALLOWED MARTYRS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM
The Emperor’s radiance shines upon his
warriors, emboldening them amidst the
thick of battle in their darkest hour.
WHEN: Command phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit
from your army that is below its Starting
Strength. For the purposes of this
Stratagem, if a unit has a Starting Strength
of 1, it is considered to be below its
Starting Strength while it has lost one or
more wounds.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your
unit can ignore any or all modifiers to
its characteristics and/or to any roll or
test made for it (excluding modifiers to
saving throws).
HOLY RAGE
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
With psalms on their lips, the faithful hurl
themselves forward, striking the foe down
with the inner strength born of faith in
the Emperor.
WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from
your army that has not been selected to
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit makes a melee
attack, add 1 to the Wound roll.

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Stratagems.
SPIRIT OF THE MARTYR
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Even with their dying act, the Sororitas
mete out the Emperor’s judgement.
WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit
from your army that was selected as the
target of one or more of the attacking
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if
that model has not fought this phase, do
not remove it from play. The destroyed
model can fight after the attacking
model’s unit has finished making attacks,
and is then removed from play.
SUFFERING & SACRIFICE
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
Suffering is a staple prayer for the Adepta
Sororitas, and a martyr’s fate only brings
greater glory to the God-Emperor.
WHEN: Start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas Infantry
or Adepta Sororitas Walker unit from
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each
time an enemy model within Engagement
range of your unit selects targets, it must
select your unit as the target of its attacks.
REJOICE THE FALLEN
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM
The death of a Battle Sister only stirs
the survivors to fight harder to exact
swift vengeance.
WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,
just after an enemy unit has resolved
its attacks.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit
from your army that had one or more of
its models destroyed as a result of the
attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were
your Shooting phase, but it must target
only that enemy unit when doing so, and
can only do so if that enemy unit is an
eligible target.

SAINTLY EXAMPLE
With her final breath is another heroine elevated to
the ranks of sainthood, her death stirring her greatest
companions to finish what she started.
Adepta Sororitas model only. When the bearer is
destroyed, you gain an additional D3 Miracle dice.
BLADE OF SAINT ELLYNOR
This blade is forged from thrice-blessed silver,
quenched in the blood of a hundred martyred heroes.
On one side the names and deeds of a thousand
saints are inscribed on the molecular level, while the
other side is etched with the entire Fede Imperialis.
The blade glows with righteous power and has slain
heretics, mutants and xenos beyond counting.
Adepta Sororitas model only. Add 1 to the
Attacks, Strength and Damage characteristics of
the bearer’s melee weapons. If the bearer has lost
one or more wounds, add 2 to the Attacks, Strength
and Damage characteristics of the bearer’s melee
weapons instead.
LITANIES OF FAITH
When Sebastian Thor was declared Ecclesiarch in
the wake of the Age of Apostasy, his first sermon
was transcribed onto scrolls by an army of scribes.
Today, only a single original copy remains, kept in a
stasis vault beneath the Convent Prioris on Terra and
released only with the sanction of the Ecclesiarch
himself. This unassuming parchment is one of the
holiest relics in the Ministorum’s charge, its mere
presence enough to fill the hearts of the faithful with
righteous fervour.
Adepta Sororitas model only. At the end of your
Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield,
you can re-roll one Miracle dice from your Miracle dice
pool and return it to your Miracle dice pool with the
new result you rolled. When doing so, if the bearer has
lost one or more wounds or is leading a unit that is
Below Half-strength, you can re-roll up to three Miracle
dice in this way instead.
MANTLE OF OPHELIA
The Mantle of Ophelia was once the badge of office
for the Prioress of the Convent Sanctorum, and was
worn by Helena the Virtuous, a Living Saint and one of
the most revered leaders in the history of the Adepta
Sororitas. The mantle is thought to have sacred
powers of protection, for Helena was said to have
anointed it with the Tears of the Emperor, a phial of
blood-like liquid meticulously collected over a century
from weeping statues of the Emperor found across
the cardinal worlds of the Imperium.
Canoness or Palatine model only. Each time an
attack is allocated to the bearer, change the Damage
characteristic of that attack to 1.

heretics with thundering salvoes from their boltguns.

Retributors are highly experienced warriors, and amongst the finest

Sisters join their ranks. Providing long-range fire support is a task that
requires excellent target prioritisation skills, as well as the ability to
optimise firing solutions and identify enemy weak points.
